## Vehicle-code deduplication

Same `CÓDIGO DE VEHÍCULO` can appear in multiple rows with only `FECHA PROCESO` differing (reprocessing) -- distinct from the exact-row duplicates already removed per `docs/deduplication_workflow.md`. One row is kept per vehicle (earliest `fecha`).

| | |
|---|---|
| Rows before | 3,006,478 |
| Unique vehicles after | 2,587,129 |
| Rows removed | 419,349 (13.9%) |
| Vehicles that spanned 2+ different ISO weeks pre-dedup | 166,798 |

## Scope filter

| | Rows | % |

| Total (all SRI classes, post vehicle-dedup) | 2,587,129 | 100.0% |
| Kept (in-scope classes) | 2,491,511 | 96.3% |
| Dropped (out-of-scope classes) | 95,618 | 3.7% |

### Dropped, by class

| Clase | Rows dropped |
