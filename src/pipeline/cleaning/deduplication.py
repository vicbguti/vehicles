"""
src/pipeline/cleaning/deduplication.py

Handles a duplication pattern distinct from exact-row duplicates (already
removed per docs/deduplication_workflow.md, reports/data_deduplication_summary.md):
the same physical vehicle (`CÓDIGO DE VEHÍCULO`) appears in multiple rows
with a different `FECHA PROCESO`, everything else identical. Confirmed on
the real 2026 export: 164,503 rows / 143,852 unique vehicle codes, and 9,395
of those vehicles land in two *different* ISO weeks across their duplicate
rows -- if not collapsed before weekly grouping, the same vehicle would
appear as needing transport in two separate weekly episodes.

Policy: keep the row with the EARLIEST `fecha` (FECHA PROCESO) per vehicle
code -- interpreted as the vehicle's first processing event; later rows for
the same code are treated as reprocessing/corrections of that same event,
not new vehicles. Team decision (2026-07-17). Pass `keep="last"` to reverse
this if that interpretation changes later.
