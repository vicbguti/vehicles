Turns data/features/vehicles_in_scope.parquet into labeled training
instances for the imitation-learning "student" model:

    group by (iso_year, iso_week, canton)          <- the natural episode unit
        -> drop groups with N < FLOOR (=5)          <- see conversation: below this,
                                                         the current fleet policy makes
                                                         a binding decision ~impossible
        -> stratified subsample to <= MAX_N (=20)    <- labeler's practical budget
        -> synthetic truck fleet (n_trucks, capacities)
        -> labeler.assign_vehicles()                 <- exact optimal assignment
    -> one row per episode  (data/episodes/episodes.parquet)
    -> one row per (episode, vehicle)  (data/episodes/episode_vehicles.parquet)

Reproducibility: every random draw for an episode (which vehicles get
subsampled, the truck fleet, and the labeler's within-class tie-breaking)
comes from ONE `random.Random` seeded from a stable hash of the episode key
(iso_year, iso_week, canton) -- NOT Python's built-in `hash()`, which is
randomized per-process by PYTHONHASHSEED and would silently break
reproducibility across runs. Same episode key always -> same training
example, on any machine, any run.
