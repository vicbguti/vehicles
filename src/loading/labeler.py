src/loading/labeler.py

Exhaustive (exact) teacher labeler for the vehicle-to-truck loading problem.

Scope decision (see reports/03_proposals/fleet_routing/02_scope.md):
No external solver (OR-Tools, PuLP, MIP libraries, etc.) is used. This is a
from-scratch exact search over the assignment space, written and owned by
the team.

Problem
-------
Given N vehicles (each with a CU weight, determined by its CLASE) and n
trucks (each with a capacity, possibly different per truck and per episode),
assign each vehicle to exactly one truck or to "no truck" (deferred), such
that no truck's total assigned CU exceeds its capacity, maximizing -- in
this strict priority order:

    1. number of vehicles loaded (not deferred)
    2. total CU utilized across all trucks (tie-breaker among solutions
       that load the same number of vehicles)

The objective is lexicographic: maximize vehicles transported, then maximize
space utilization.

Design notes
------------
- CU values are scaled to integers via exact fractions (fractions.Fraction),
  using the LCM of all denominators present in a given episode. A *fixed*
  decimal scale (e.g. always x10) silently corrupts repeating fractions like
  2/3 (round(2/3 * 10) = 7, but 12 * 7 != 12 * (2/3) * 10) -- this produced a
  wrong, non-obviously-wrong answer during development and is exactly the
  kind of bug that must not exist in the label source of truth. Fractions
  make the integer scaling exact regardless of which CU values are chosen.

- Search space: vehicles are grouped by CLASE first. Within a class every
  vehicle has the same CU, so for the *optimization* they are interchange-
  able -- CANTON and other per-vehicle attributes do not affect the capacity
  constraint (loading-only scope, no routing). This collapses the search
  from "which of N individual vehicles" (permutation-sized) to "how many of
  each of the (few) classes" (count-tuple-sized), which is the same
  simplification the PDF itself uses in Sec. I (solving for S and D counts,
  not for which specific SUV/Sedan). The state space is then the tuple of
  remaining counts per class, memoized across trucks -- an exact dynamic
  program, not a heuristic.
  Concretely, for 17 vehicles across 4 classes this cut search time from
  ~1.3s / ~2M nodes (item-level branch-and-bound) to a few milliseconds.
  Individual vehicles within a class are re-attached to their truck
  deterministically (sorted by uid) after the class-count solution is found.

- A wall-clock time budget bounds worst-case runtime for batch labeling over
  many historical weeks. If the budget is hit, the best assignment found so
  far is returned with `optimal=False`, so downstream code can filter or
  flag non-certified labels instead of silently trusting them.
